# Pets

This project was created for UI SDK version 2+ with angular 6+. It should be starting point for any new project within Accelya Group Products and Applications.

## Recommendation for development

We suggest using visual studio code editor, as it's open source, free, has plugin support and it performs very good on different OS.

Suggested plugins for better workflow. (Please install these plugins ) :100:
